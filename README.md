# Python-Networking
Scripts that are nothing but me messing around with sockets

RC.py script listens for data being sent on the IP and port number
<br> sender.py sends the data to the IP and port.
<br> With this I plan to send commands to another computer on the same network
<br> Also with this I want to make a chat room with flask
